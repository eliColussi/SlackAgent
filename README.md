# Welcome to My Slack Bot Project!

Hello there! I'm thrilled you're interested in using my Slack Bot project. This bot is designed to help you interact with Slack more efficiently, offering functionalities like editing messages, writing proposals, and more. Don't worry if you're new to this; I'll guide you through the setup process step by step.

## Getting Started

First things first, let's get a copy of this project onto your local machine for development and testing purposes. Trust me, it's not as complicated as it sounds!

### Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: This is the programming language we'll be using.
- **pip**: This is the Python package installer, which you'll use to set up your environment.
- **Git**: We'll use this to clone the repository.

if you are unsure about how to install any of these pull out gpt or use google, there's lot's of great documentation out there.
### Cloning the Repository

1. **Open Your Terminal**: This could be your Command Prompt, Terminal, or Git Bash, whatever you prefer.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone [Repository URL]
   ```

   Please replace `[Your Repository URL]` with the link to this repository.

3. **Navigate to the Repository Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd [Repository Name]
   ```

   Change `[Repository Name]` to the actual name of the repository folder.

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (This step is optional but recommended to keep dependencies tidy):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate it by using the following command:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On Unix or MacOS:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Run the following to get all the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuring the Application

Let's make sure the app has all it needs to run:

1. **Set Up Your Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the project's root and include your Slack credentials like so:

   ```env
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your-slack-bot-token
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-slack-signing-secret
   SLACK_BOT_USER_ID=your-slack-bot-user-id
   ```

   Just replace the placeholders with your actual Slack app credentials.

   again there is lots of great resources if you are unsure of how to obtain these credentials.

### Running the Application

Alright, almost there! Let's run the app:

1. **Start the Flask App**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Your Flask server should start, and the Slack application will be up and running.

### Testing the Application

Now, let's test it to ensure everything's working perfectly. Head over to your Slack workspace and try out the bot by mentioning it with the appropriate commands.
